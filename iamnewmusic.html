<img src="images/iamphone.png" alt="IAM NEW MUSIC - phone screenshot" class="phoneshot" /><p class="pwork">Lowri and Ben from promotions company IAM NEW MUSIC contacted me after they had already amassed a significant following on multiple social networks and acquired an office in the renowned Metropolis Studios. They had never had a dedicated website, and wanted to be able to take charge of updating and editing their own multimedia content online. Lowri and Ben already had a clear idea of the kind of aesthetic they wanted; minimalist, monochrome, and allowing the video and image content to provide the only pops of colour on the page.</p>

<p class="pwork">I delivered a Wordpress-built website using a modification based on Elegant Themes to allow it to operate like a true CMS - by selecting a category when creating a post, the blog post, image, calendar event or announcement would be sent automatically to populate the appropriate page. Videos were pulled automatically from IAM's Youtube channel, and the site was designed to be fully mobile-friendly.</p>

<p class="pwork">Lowri and Ben were delighted with their completed website; it was a pleasure to work with them and we are currently discussing future plans for the expansion of the site.
