<h2>Alejandra Jimenez</h2>

<p>Alejandra, a filmmaker and animator, got in touch with me via my diploma course. Despite hosting much of her work on Vimeo she had little web presence to speak of, and needed help creating a website which she could update easily herself.</p>

<p>Because Alejandra's work was already hosted on Vimeo, she wanted to use its Gallery plugin in lieu of a CMS, which would automatically pull her videos from her Vimeo channel into the site's static HTML pages to make long-term maintenance of her site very easy. She requested a very minimalist layout in a warm beige, with no visual content other than videos and text; the focus of the layout became the beautiful open-source font Raleway, while a sliding jQuery submenu in the sidebar allowed for less clutter in the overall layout.</p>

<p>Alejandra's site was created in standards-compliant, validating XHTML1.0 and CSS2.1, and is built to be fully responsive (although the Vimeo plugin made styling the video thumbnails for different screen-widths a particular challenge, and I might in future suggest the use of a more customisable CMS to a client who required both easy updating and mobile view).</p>

<p>I attempted to create a type folly for Alejandra's logo, but found that Raleway's baselines differed slightly between screen resolutions and operating systems, and ultimately opted for an image. I do feel that, where possible, a folly is often a more pleasing and accessible solution for text-only logos, and in future might consider this a priority before selecting a font.</p>

<p>Alejandra's video art is beautiful and ambitious; it was a privilege to work with her, and I hope my design satisfactorily showcases her creations.</p>
