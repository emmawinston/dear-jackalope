<img src="images/brigittephone.png" alt="Brigitte D'Angelo - phone screenshot" class="phoneshot" /><p class="pwork">The Page To Performance website was a collaborative redesign between myself and Jason Hart of <a href="http://www.kickmouth.com">Kickmouth</a>. I had worked with Jason in an assistant role prior to Page To Performance's commission, but this site represented our first truly equal collaboration; both design and development were a joint effort.</p>

<p class="pwork">Page To Performance is the brainchild of performance poet <a href="http://www.holliemcnish.com">Hollie McNish</a>; a collective of creative poetry, rap, dj and dance practitioners based in the East of England, they specialise in running workshops for schools, youth clubs and community groups. Both Jason and I were hugely excited by their work, and were keen to help them resurrect their rather dated website.</p>

<p class="pwork">The site was built in Wordpress, using a heavily modified existing theme which we selected largely for its neat implementation of a full-width slideshow on the front page - Hollie provided us with numerous excellent photos, which are prominent throughout the site but most especially on the homepage. Since the site was relatively text-heavy, we used compact image sliders to display the organisation's sponsors and reviews of the workshops. The site is also fully responsive and mobile-friendly. </p> 

<p class="pwork">The Page To Performance website remains a work in progress; a blog and press page have been developed and will shortly be pushed to the live site, allowing the collective a greater level of engagement with their audience.</p>
