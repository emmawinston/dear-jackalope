<p>Dan was a close friend with whom I had previously worked in a creative context, whose existing website for his band Enderby's Room needed bringing up to date. Dan's existing website was built in the now-obsolete iWeb for Mac, was relatively inaccessible and was not responsive or friendly to diverse screen-sizes. Dan also loved the line-drawing on the homepage of his old website, but had obtained it from Flickr many years previously and could not remember its source or licensing details.</p>

<p>We decided that the site's existing content would be maintained, as would its 'handmade' feel and branding, but that I would work to make it accessible and responsive, and to bring it up to date. I replaced the typewritten images which made up the header and buttons with a typewriter-style web font, and drew from scratch my own version of the homepage image, featuring Dan himself in a room with a harmonium organ, the band's 'unique selling point'.</p>

<p>Dan often struggled to keep the site up to date during the band's busy periods, so I created pages which automatically pulled information from Songkick for live tour dates and Soundcloud for studio recordings. It was, however, important to Dan that he could still modify content and maintain the site himself as he had done in iWeb, so I made every text field on the site editable with Pagelime CMS so that he would not have to edit code and risk breaking his layout.</p> 

<p>Dan was very pleased with Enderby's Room's new website; by maintaining the band's branding while still drastically modernising the site, Enderby's Room's web presence is now accessible and mobile-friendly while retaining a homemade and handmade feel.</p>
