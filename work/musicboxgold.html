<p>The microsite for Musicbox Gold was created, from scratch to launch, within a three-hour window. Galen and Stephen contacted me around midday via email needing a three-page site for a presentation that evening, and asked me if I could build it by 3pm that day.</p> 

<p>Galen and Stephen requested a simple homepage with a futuristic typographic logo, an explanatory page featuring a video (which had not yet been completed), and a biography page with photos and short biographies of the developers. The site was built in standards-compliant, fully-validating XHTML1.0 and CSS2.1, is semantically coded and accessible to screenreaders.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, we chose to make the layout of the site flexible and percentage-based but without the use of media queries - as such, it is not fully responsive, but functions reasonably well on a range of different screen sizes nonetheless.</p>

<p>Because Galen and Stephen were still creating the video for the site's explanatory page during the coding process, I made all the site's major content fields editable from within Pagelime CMS so that they would be able to embed it themselves when it was complete.</p> 

<p>Galen and Stephen were a pleasure to work with - despite the inevitable stresses of building and launching a site in a single afternoon, the build process was smooth and designing and developing for MusicBox Gold was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.</p>
