  			<h2>Galen </h2> <img id="galen" class="bio cms-editable" src="images/galen.jpg" alt="Galen's photo" />
  			<p class="biotext">Galen comes from a long line of music lovers who have never mastered any instruments. He does like to write music though, and has a strong interest in using computers to generate music. He codes in a few languages and would love to become a pilot once a cure for his colour blindness has been found.</p>

  			<h2>Stephen</h2> <img id="stephen" class="bio cms-editable" src="images/stephen.png" alt="Stephen's photo" />
  			<p class="biotext">Stephen loves playing and writing music, as well as learning about how we perceive and understand it. He plays with three other guys in the Quintessential Sax quartet and recently joined the Irish Composers' Collective. He has a great ear and imagination for music, but he also has a hard-nosed instinct for a bargain.
