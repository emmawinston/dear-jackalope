  			<h2>What We Do</h2>
  			<p>Video game developers today are limited only by their imagination. You can create great games without being an expert in graphics, physics, or hardware management - and that's as it should be.</p>

			<p>We believe that music, like language, belongs to everyone. But many developers don't feel confident in creating their own game music. We want to give you the tools to do just that.</p>

			<p>If music is a language, then MusicBox is a phrasebook. We can't wait to hear what you have to say.</p>
